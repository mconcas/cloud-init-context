**************************************************************
In this folder all the scripts you need to create 
the user-data MIME for workernodes.
**************************************************************

In the folder 'sensitive_data' there are ssh-keys and 
other configuration files with passwords.
These informations should be embedded in the archieve.

All other needed files can be found in 'CloudInitFiles'.
This folder could go into a web server.
 
User-data can be:
  - embedded from local folder (should be the case for sensitive data)
  - embedded from web server
  - fetched from web server at boot (convenient to avoid large user-data files)
